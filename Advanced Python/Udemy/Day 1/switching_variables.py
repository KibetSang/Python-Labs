# If we have two physical glasses and we wanted to switch out the contents. 
# We would need to grab an extra glass! 
# So the solution is to create a temporary variable 
# To store the contents from one glass.
temp = glass1
# By storing the contents of glass1 in the temp variable. 
# We can now use the glass1 variable to store the contents of glass2
glass1 = glass2
# Finally, we can put the contents in the temp variable into glass2.
glass2 = temp
